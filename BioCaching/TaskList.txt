High Priority (For v1.0 - Internal Test Release)
+ Full curation of trip list
+ Go back to previously created trips (whatever status)
+ User entered trip title
+ Change search process so occurrences/taxa only added to explore/trip list once taxon details available (either from local database or iNat API call)
+ Record basic observation details and assign to trip
+ Add photo to observation records
- Push all associated observation records (and photos) to iNat
+ Better user feedback (i.e. ensure network activity spinner animating) when sending/receiving data over internet
- Change default search view to current location with 1km radius (use settings to change default) - span or radius?
- Add control/button to map for current location


Medium Priority (For v1.1 - Full Public Release)
- Add control/button to map for map type?
- Add "Follow User" button to map screen (or option in settings page?)
- Add alternative Explore Summary screen for when viewing saved trip, with editable trip details rather than search results (i.e. trip title, description, times etc)
- Prevent starting a trip if outside the search area boundary
- Display warning alert during trip if user goes outside search area boundary (record the number of times this happens - suggested storing this on iNat along with the trip, but there's no capacity in the API such as "trip_field_values" for this at the moment)
- Better info/error handling when offline or web services unavailable
- Fix up Website Viewer (as used for BHL species links) with back button
- User editing of trip details before submission to iNat
- Recording/editing of notes field on observation details
- Ability to go back and edit key observation details (i.e. DateTime and Location) before publication to iNat?
- Better UX for deleting taxa from trip list (edit list/delete confirmation)
- Deletion of taxa from trip not searched for before submission to iNat?
- Hook up trip map and list screens so selected item is highlighted when changing screens
- Swipe to next occurrence/record (when viewing trip)
- Redo/duplicate existing (completed) trip
- Fix any UI issues for iOS 6


Lower Priority (Possible For v1.1+ - Post Release Updates)
- Location/place name search from ExploreMap screen (to replace/compliment drop down list of predefined locations)
- Retrieval of multiple pictures for trip list taxa
- Recording of trip GPS track


Currently Out of Scope (Wishlist for v2.0+ - Future Versions)
- Full synching/updating of trips (and associated observations) with iNat (after initial post)


Other UI/UX Issues/Change Requests/Suggestions (need prioritising)
- Search area to be calculated/approximated to circle (currently displayed as circle but simple square used as polygon for actual search params)
- Resize/zoom taxon images to fill area edge-to-edge (occurrence details screen)
- Move main menu button in toolbar to top level view controller so that button works on all child views, e.g. Explore map/list/summary
- Fix-up Settings screen so it works properly from main menu (as well as from ExploreMap screen)
- Remove "Area Span" option from Settings screen?  Remove Settings button from ExploreMap screen completely (just access through sidebar menu)?
- Keep "Remove" button on individual TaxonDetails/OccurrenceDetails screens once trip has been started?
- Implement ability to edit ExploreList screen so items can still be removed from list once trip started (change tableview to edit mode, replacing record button with remove)
- Change Explore List screen to show center location of current trip
- Disable background view when main menu displayed (clicking in background view should slide menu away)
- Change Z position of (or hide) segmented control for on Explore screen so that it is behind/disappears when location menu displayed
- Add Trip control buttons (save/start/stop) to ExploreList/Summary screen (as well as ExploreMap)
- Fix issue with some screens not in scrolling down to see all information (e.g. Trip Summary or Occurrence Details)
- Fix display issue with segmented control on explore screen
- Add some kind of indicator (e.g. X of Y text in header, or change map icon in some way) on map (and list) screen to quickly show which/how many records on current trip have been found/recorded?

Ongoing Technical Tasks/TODOs
+ Keep list of deleted occurrences (manual or automatic) and underlying Occurrence objects (rather than completing deleting from OccurrenceResults)
- Refactor BCOptions (Persist original SearchOptions to OccurrenceResults/Trip, use NSUserDefaults for current Options)
- Enforce use of decimal variables for GPS related values (as opposed to default double/float) to ensure fixed precision with no rounding
- Improve image caching to store taxa images in applications Library/Caches folder rather than using the general iOS URLCache
- Enable addition of extra occurrence search results to unsaved trip lists (currently limited to one GBIF request of max 300 occurrences)
- Change upload process to do all observations THEN observation photos THEN final trip
- Add additional/detailed feedback delegates to show upload progress
- Create observation_field_value for original GBIF recordId
- Add GBIF recordId observation_field_value to each observation posted to iNat
