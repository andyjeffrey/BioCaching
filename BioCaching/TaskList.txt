High Priority (Required For v1.0 - Internal Test Release)
- Full curation of trip list
- Go back to previously created trips (whatever status)
- User entered trip title
- Change search process so occurrences/taxa only added once taxa details available (either from local database or iNat API call)
- Record basic observation details and assign to trip
- Add photo to observation records
- Push all associated observation records (and photos) to iNat
- Fix up Website Viewer (as used for BHL species links) with back button
- Better progress updates (loading spinner etc) when sending/receiving data over internet
- Better info/error handling when offline or web services unavailable


Medium Priority (Probable For v1.1 - Full Public Release)
- User editing of trip details before submission to iNat
- Better UX for deleting taxa from trip list (edit list/delete confirmation)
- Deletion of taxa from trip not searched for before submission to iNat?
- Hook up trip map and list screens so selected item is highlighted when changing screens
- Swipe to next occurrence/record (when viewing trip)
- Redo/duplicate existing (completed) trip
- "Follow User" option?
- Fix any UI issues for iOS 6


Low Priority (Possible For v1.1+ - Post Release Updates)
- Retrieval of multiple pictures for trip list taxa




Currently Out of Scope (Wishlist for v2.0+ - Future Versions)
- Full synching/updating of trips (and associated observations) with iNat (after initial post)




Ongoing Tasks/TODOs (Uncategorised)
- Refactor BCOptions (Persist original SearchOptions to OccurrenceResults/Trip, use NSUserDefaults for current DisplayOptions?)
- Keep list of deleted occurrences (manual or automatic) and underlying Occurrence objects (rather than completing deleting from OccurrenceResults)
- Enable addition of extra occurrence search results to unsaved trip lists (currently limited to one GBIF request of max 300 occurrences)
